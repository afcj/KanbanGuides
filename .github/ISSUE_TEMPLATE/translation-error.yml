        Thanks for helping us improve the quality of our translations! 

        Translation quality is a community effort. Your feedback helps the translation community maintain and improve content for all users. Reports and suggestions are welcomed from anyone - whether you're a member of the translation community or a user of the translated content.

        **Community Approach:** Remember that translations are community-owned. This report will be shared with the translation community for that language, and multiple community members may collaborate on the resolution.
